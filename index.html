    <h2>Rainbox Six Siege</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Rainbox Six Siege is a tactical team based game that I play at home on my
      computer. It is a multiplayer game that requires you to play against
      another team of people in order to claim victory.

    <h2>Burnaby</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Burnaby is my favourite vacation location as it is where I go at least
      once every year during the summer, the nature is beautiful and the weather
      is fair. The main thing that draws me is my maternal side of the family
      mainly lives there. meaning that it is the only way for me to see them
      other than video calling them online.
    </p>

    <h2>May 9th</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      May 9th is one of if not my favourite day of the year, this day is the day
      that I was brought into this world. It is my birthday and is when I can
      get things that I want because of people gifting it to me.
